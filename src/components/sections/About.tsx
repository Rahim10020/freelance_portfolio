                    Since the beginning of my journey as a freelance designer over a decade ago,
                    I've had the opportunity to work remotely with agencies, consult for startups,
                    and collaborate with talented people to create digital products for both business and everyday users.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My main focus these days is building accessible, user-centered products for a variety
                    of clients. I enjoy working across the full stackâ€”from designing intuitive interfaces
                    to implementing robust backend systems. I specialize in creating applications that
                    not only look great but also perform exceptionally well.
