                    Back in 2019, I decided to dive into the world of software development and discovered
                    my passion for creating digital experiences. What started as curiosity quickly evolved
                    into a professional career building modern applications.

                <p>
                    My main focus these days is building accessible, user-centered products for a variety
                    of clients. I enjoy working across the full stackâ€”from designing intuitive interfaces
                    to implementing robust backend systems. I specialize in creating applications that
                    not only look great but also perform exceptionally well.

                <p>
                    When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring new technologies, contributing to
                    open-source projects, or sharing knowledge with the developer community.
